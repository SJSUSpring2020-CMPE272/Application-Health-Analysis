## Project Idea – 1

###### Title: 
Project Management and Risk Predictor 

###### Description:
Students working in their Academic Team Projects face the difficulties of tracking their project progress and issues they find in the course of project implementation. Students tend to forget committing code to GitHub, may miss fixing an issue due to improper issue tracking, fail to detect risk in completing the project etc. due to which the risk of the project missing the deadline might increase. To avoid these kind of risks this Application with GitHub integration analyses the git commits made by the contributors of the project, the number of open and closed pull requests, the number of issues open and closed, the frequency of  issues and commits and will help in tracking the progress of the project with respect to the timeline. And will also warn the users if it detects any problem in the process they are following. Students collaborating on a project can create teams and others can join the team and will provide the details of the GitHub repositories and their GitHub usernames. Once that is setup, they can track the status of the project on the dashboard, the commits they make, the trends in the commits, manage pull requests, the issues open currently, can create issue for a project which will be created on GitHub and can be tracked and managed from the Applications Dashboard which will help them track the bugs they find in the project and also to distribute load among themselves. If the application finds any risks on the project, the users will be notified. The backend server can be deployed on AWS Lambda to make it serverless to minimize the costs in paying for the server usage even when the it doesn’t serve any user requests. 

###### Goal:
This application will help Students and individuals working on personal projects track their status of project, help identify risks, create and track issues which will help them in efficient tracking and managing the project as per the timelines.

React JS, Redux, Node JS, Mongo DB, AWS 


## Project Idea-2

###### Title: Applications Health Analysis. 
# Approved

###### Idea Description: 
Application to log all the success and failures of all applications and analyzing the health of the main Application with their dependent applications of a Major Application. This will aid in troubleshooting and and fixing the issues arising in the deployments and will help in fixing the issues with microservices which are failing frequently due to which a lot of man hours are wasted in indentifying the root cause of the failure.

###### Goal of the project: 
Any Major application which will be formed by a different set of micro services, so there will be many inter dependent API’s which will be failing due to many issues. Applications Health Analysis will give the detail a report of what are the API’s which are failing with frequency and dependent API’s which are getting effected by the failed API’s. Notifying all the failed API’s contacts based on the frequency. By which which we can indetify the issues mainly in the production environements where a single failure of an API will cause a feature to break. We can also track the modules of the product which are failing frequently and take necessary actions on it and testing them thouroughly before releasing them. 

###### Technology stack:
AWS, Splunk, Java Spring, HTML/CSS 


## Project Idea – 3

###### Title:
Math Made Easy
###### Idea Description:
Idea of the project is to evaluate handwritten mathematical expressions by identifying them using deep learning and to provide a stepwise solution to the user. 
###### Goal: 
Handwritten digit recognition- a mix of deep learning and neural networking is used to identify the handwritten digits. It is the ability of computers to recognize human handwritten digits. It is a hard task for the machine as handwritten digits and math expressions are not perfect and can be made with many different flavors. Our application simplifies the problem by using the image of the math expression. It recognizes each literal present in the image and then evaluates it. Moreover, a step wise approach that brings out the solution will be presented for a better understanding of how the problem is evaluated.

###### Technologies: 
REACT, NODEJS, AWS, Python
